harvest-timesheet-transfer
==========================

**THIS PROJECT IS EMPTY RIGHT NOW**

Transfer Harvest timesheet data from client's account to your own account

Warnings:

**This project is untested and not ready to do anything useful!**

Someone who knows what they are doing should probably fork this and make something better out of it :)


Why:

I use my client's Harvest account to track my time as I work on thier projects. At the end of each 
month, I have to export my time as a csv from my client's account, manually format it and then 
upload it into my Harvest account so that I can create my invoice. 

This is horribly error-prone and I'm really sick of doing it.
